Current Operations
+++++++++++++++++++++

- get the current code working that has been given to us by the Google dev co-op

- email Empac visualization contact to include him in the visualization side of the project early on in the process

- solidify whether or not certain software will be made Open Source, if so, add to github, compile, and determine what we can and cannot use


Future Work to be Done
++++++++++++++++++++++

- once the already open source code packages are parsed through and what is left is code that we can use productively and run is in the github repository

- add necessary code to combine all the open source snippets together, add code that is needed on this platform level

- build off of this platform to produce a program that has output (program walkthrough breakpoints, 'mapping' of the processes --> details of these internal stages) that will work as input for the visualization element of the project
