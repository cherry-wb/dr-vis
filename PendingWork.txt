Current Operations
+++++++++++++++++++++

- get the current code working that has been given to us by the Google dev co-op

- email Empac visualization contact to include him in the visualization side of the project early on in the process

- solidify whether or not certain software will be made Open Source, if so, add to github, compile, and determine what we can and cannot use


Future Work to be Done
++++++++++++++++++++++

- once the already open source code packages are parsed through and what is left is code that we can use productively and run is in the github repository

- add necessary code to combine all the open source snippets together, add code that is needed on this platform level

- build off of this platform to produce a program that has output (program walkthrough breakpoints, 'mapping' of the processes --> details of these internal stages) that will work as input for the visualization element of the project

Running with 
cd dynamorio/build
./bin64/drrun -c api/samples/bin/libbbbuf.so -- ls

Need to determine start/end address of program to filter
	For .exe files, it's in the PE Header. For .o (linux) files, it's in the ELF Header

	Python ELF scripts gives info including:

Entry point address:             : 4195264, 0x4003c0
Start of program headers (offset): 64, 0x40 bytes
Start of section headers (offset): 2496, 0x9c0 bytes

	for program that runs from
		0x4004b0 to
		0x4004c2

Difference between EP and actual EP is compiler optimizations (should we filter?)
